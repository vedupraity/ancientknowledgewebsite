Those who are devoted to the lotusfeet of their preceptor are highly blessed from the point of view of the world as well as of the Vedas.

With his body thrilling all over he stood in the assembly and tears of love gushed forth from his lotus eyes. "The lord of sages has already said what I had to say. Beyond that I have nothing to submit. I know the disposition of my master, who is never angry even with the offender. To me he has been particularly kind and affectionate; I have never seen him frown even in play. Even from my infancy I never left his company and at no time did he damp my spirits.

The people, on the other hand, rejoiced to think that their stay was ensured for some days more. In this way that day too was spent. The next morning everyone proceeded to bathe. And after their ablutions the men and women worshipped Lord Gaṇeśa, Goddess Gaurī (Śiva Consort), Bhagavān Śiva (the Slayer of the demon Tripura) and the Sun-god (the Dispeller of darkness). Again, they reverenced the feet of Bhagavān Viṣṇu* (the Lord of Lakṣmī) and prayed, the men raising their joined palms, the women holding out the skirt of their garment (after the way of beggars); "With Śrī Rāma our king and Sītā (Janaka's Daughter) our queen, may our capital Ayodhyā, be gloriously repeopled with its various communities and grow to be the very culmination of joy; and may Śrī Rāma instal Bharata as the Crown Prince.

Having thus performed their daily devotions the citizens made obeisance to Śrī Rāma with a thrill of joy. Men and women of every rank-high, low or middling-were blessed with His sight according to their own conception. Śrī Rāma scrupulously honoured all and everyone praised the Storehouse of Compassion in the following words: "From his very boyhood it has been Śrī Rāma's wont to observe the rules of propriety, duly recognizing the love one cherishes towards him. With a lovely and cheerful countenance, gracious looks and a guileless disposition the Lord of Raghus is an ocean of amiability and modesty." Thus recounting the virtues of Śrī Rāma they were all overwhelmed with emotion and began to extol their good fortune: "There are few people in the world as meritorious as we, whom Śrī Rāma recognizes as his own!" </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce pb-0"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="pagination is-centered" role=navigation  aria-label=pagination > <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-previous pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/40/" > Previous </a> <ul class=pagination-list > <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/1/" > 1 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/40/" > 40 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" disabled > 41 </a> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/42/" > 42 </a> <li> <span class=pagination-ellipsis >…</span> <li> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-link" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/49/" > 49 </a> </ul> <a type=button  role=button  aria-hidden=true  class="button is-outlined is-warning pagination-next pagination-button" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/42/" > Next </a> </nav> </div> </section> <section class="section animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="box glass animated fadeInUpShort"> <nav class="breadcrumb is-medium is-centered" aria-label=breadcrumbs > <ul> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-home" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Home</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-book" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Shri Ramcharitmanas (English)</span> </a> <li > <a class="is-link has-text-orange" href="/ramcharitmanas-english/2/"> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-file-alt" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>2 - Ayodhyā Kaanda</span> </a> <li class=is-active > <a tabindex=-1  href=""> <span class="icon is-small"> <i class="fas fa-quote-right" aria-hidden=true ></i> </span> <span>Part 41</span> </a> </ul> </nav> </div> </section> <section aria-hidden=true  class="section pt-0 animatedParent animateOnce" > <article class="box message is-warning is-small p-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <div class="message-header is-justify-content-center"> <p>Copyright Notice</p> </div> <div class="message-body has-text-centered"> <p > Material used on this page belongs to and copyrighted under Gitapress, Gorakhpur. </p> </div> </article> </section> <footer class="footer p-0"> <section class=section > <div class=footer-container > <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content-w-image is-flex is-centered-mobile"> <figure class="image is-64x64 m-0 animated fadeInUpShort"> <img src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/images/logo.png"> </figure> <div class="content m-0 is-flex is-flex-direction-column is-justify-content-space-between animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class=mt-0 >Ancient Knowledge</h4> <p class=is-centered-mobile > <a href="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/about/" class=no-decoration > <span>About</span> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="animatedParent animateOnce"> <div class="content animated fadeInUpShort"> <h4 class="is-centered-mobile m-0 mb-4 animated fadeInUpShort delay-500">@PraacheenGyaan</h4> <p class="has-text-centered is-flex is-justify-content-space-between animatedParent animateOnce"> <a class="box icon facebook is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-500" href="https://www.facebook.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-facebook-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon instagram is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1000" href="https://www.instagram.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-instagram-square has-text-white"></i> </a> <a class="box icon twitter is-large fa-2x mb-0 animated growIn delay-1500" href="https://www.twitter.com/PraacheenGyaan/" target=_blank > <i class="fab fa-twitter-square has-text-white"></i> </a> </p> </div> </div> </div> </section> </footer> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/script.js"></script> <script src="https://www.ancientknowledge.in/static/js/css3-animate-it.js"></script>
