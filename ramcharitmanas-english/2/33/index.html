Bharata's reply pleased the great sage (Bharadvāja), who called his trusty servants and pupils by his side. "Bharata ought to be entertained; therefore, go and bring bulbs, roots and fruits." They bowed their heads with the words 'very well, sir!' and most gladly proceeded to take charge of their respective duties. The sage anxiously thought that he had invited a distinguished guest and that a deity must be worshipped according to his or her rank.

So saying they erected beautiful dwellings of various patterns, which put to shame by their appearance the aerial cars of gods. They were replete with abundant luxuries and splendours, which were coveted by immortals. Equipped with necessaries of all kinds men-servants and maid-servants remained in attendance focussing their attention on the pleasure of the guests. The Siddhis provided in an instant all the amenities which cannot be dreamt of even in heaven.

The luxuries were more than one could describe; the wise would forget their dispassion on seeing them. There were seats and couches, drapery, canopies, groves and gardens, birds and beasts of different species, sweet-scented flowers and fruits tasting like ambrosia, many a lake and pond of limpid water, foods and drinks of an undefiled and innocent character, which were more delicious than nectar and ambrosia, and which the guests would hesitate to accept like so many ascetics. Every house was supplied with a celestial cow (the cow of plenty) and a tree of paradise; Indra (the king of gods) and his consort, Śacī, grew covetous at their sight. It was the vernal season and a cool, fragrant and gentle breeze was blowing. Everyone had all the four prizes of life (viz., religious merit, worldly riches, sensuous enjoyment and final beatitude) within one's easy reach. At the sight of luxuries like garlands, sandal-paste and women the guests were overcome by a mixed feeling of joy and sorrow (joy at the unique hospitality shown by the sage by dint of his Yogic powers and sorrow because at a time when they should abstain from luxuries of every kind they were being offered the same). </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> saṃpata cakaī bharatu caka muni āyasa khēlavāra.. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> tēhi nisi āśrama piṃjarāom rākhē bhā bhinusāra..215..

Bharata reverently received his orders and blessings and prostrating himself made much supplication. Accompanied by expert guides and taking the whole host alongwith him he proceeded on his journey with his thoughts directed towards Citrakūṭa. Holding Śrī Rāma's friend (Guha) by the hand he walked along like the very incarnation of love. He had no shoes and no umbrella over his head; and his love, self-discipline, austerity and piety were unfeigned. He asked his friend (Guha) to give an account of the wanderings of Lakṣmaṇa, Śrī Rāma and Sītā; while Guha narrated the same in soft accents. When he saw the spots where Śrī Rāma had rested and the trees under which he had halted the emotion within his breast could not be repressed.

"Even they who utter the name of Rāma only once in this world not only reach the other shore themselves but are also able to take others across. As for Bharata, he is dearly loved by Śrī Rāma and is His younger brother too. No wonder, then, that the journey should be delightful to him," Siddhas (a class of celestial beings), saints and great sages observed thus and rejoiced at heart to behold Bharata. Indra (the chief of gods) was filled with anxiety when he saw Bharata's power. The world is good to the good and vile for the vile.
