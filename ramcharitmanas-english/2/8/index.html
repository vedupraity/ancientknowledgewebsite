"If I press my son and detain him, the moral code will be violated and bad blood created between brothers. And if I allow him to proceed to the woods, it will be a grievous loss." The queen thus found herself faced with an embarrassing situation and was overwhelmed with grief.

With Her head bent low Sītā, who was beauty personified and cherished unalloyed love towards Her Lord, sat reflecting, "The lord of my life would depart to the forest; it has yet to be seen who will have the good fortune to accompany Him-my body and soul together or my soul alone. What God intends to do cannot be foreseen even partly." As She scratched the ground with the lovely nails of Her toes, Her anklets produced a musical sound, af if-so declare the poets- they lovingly prayed that Sītā's feet may never abandon them. Seeing Her shed tears from Her charming eyes, Śrī Rāma's mother broke the silence: "Listen, my dear child: Sītā is exceedingly delicate and the pet of her father-in-law and mothers-in-law and the whole family." </p> </div> <div class="has-text-warning-dark mb-3" > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold"> Dohas </p> </div> <div class=mb-5  > <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> pitā janaka bhūpāla mani sasura bhānukula bhānu. </p> <p class="has-text-centered has-text-weight-bold mb-1"> pati rabikula kairava bipina bidhu guna rūpa nidhānu..58..

Just when the creeper was about to blossom and bear fruit God turned against me and there is no knowing what will be the consequence. Borne invariably on a bedstead, seat, swing or my own lap Sītā has never set her foot on hard ground. I have been tending her like a life-giving herb and never ask her even to stir the wick of a lamp. The same Sītā would accompany you to the woods, and awaits your orders, O Lord of the Raghus!

Another class fit for the forest is the hermit woman, who has renounced all pleasures for the sake of penance. But how, my son, will Sītā live in the forest;-she who is frightened to see even the picture of a monkey? Is a female cygnet, who disports in the lovely lotus-beds of the Mānasa lake, fit for a muddy puddle? First ponder this; then as you order I will instruct Janaka's daughter.
